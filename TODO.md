Some things I have to fix / add:

ADD:

Solving issues<br />
2FA<br />
OAuth<br />
Developer status (already a things but has no functionality specific to it)<br />
Administrator panel and settings<br />
Ability to customize site title and various other things<br />
Dev-groups so only certain groups can view certain issues<br />

FIX:

The re-rendering and pre-fetching of data

-   This will fix old issues showing for a moment on a new page as well as the loading of the home page - This will likely be done by querying the store for a specific article rather than the database. As for the home page there will be a proper loading _thing_ implemented
