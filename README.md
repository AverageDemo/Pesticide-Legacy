# Pesticide

This will be updated later on.

Some info:

-   Developers and admins can see private issues
-   Projects are in. Dev groups are going to be added. If an issue is created for a specific project and there are developers specifically assigned to that project and the issue is made private then only the developers on the project can see it.
-   The home page and issue loading will be made prettier at the end.
-   I am going to clean up the code, don't worry ;)
-   Some of the administrative functions don't make much sense because I'm not using things like arrays to pass data to them YET. This will be fixed up once an admin panel is created.
    -   For instance, adding users to a dev group. You will be able to select multiple users then apply and it will add them. Currently you can only do one at a time.

To use:

-   If you pull it, just run `npm run dev` to start the entire project.
